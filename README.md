All of my tests are located inside of my "Sprint5Tests" package.
This package consists of three tests, one correlating to each part. Simply run any individual test to test its associated part

PLEASE NOTE: While running one of the tests, I had an issue where the test failed because the screen did not load quickly enough; I fixed that specific instance, but there may be others lingering. If a test fails, please run it again. If it continually fails, please email me.

In order to run our program, go to clientServerPackage (it should be the 8th package on the list), open up ServerWorker, and click run. This will start the server. Then, go to applicationFiles (the 3rd one down), open up BPApplication, and click run. This will start the application. This is setup in this way to accurately mimic the client-server relationship that will when the application is in use. 

Note the initial admin's username is "admin" and their password is "admin". Also note, whenever the server is started a string will be printed to the screen reporting an error since server.xml is not there.
