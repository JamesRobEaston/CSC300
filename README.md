All of our tests are located inside of our "tests" package. In order to test any individual screen, open the file associated with that screen and click Run. If you have any issues, please email james.easton@centre.edu or come talk to anyone in Weast Bridges United.

PLEASE NOTE: Some of our tests throw exceptions, these are intentional. Pay no attention to them.

In order to run our program, go to clientServerPackage (it should be the 7th package on the list), open up ServerWorker, and click run. This will start the server. Then, go to applicationFiles (the 3rd one down), open up BPApplication, and click run. This will start the application. This is setup in this way to accurately mimic the client-server relationship that will when the application is in use. 

Note the initial admin's username is "admin" and their password is "admin".
