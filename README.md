All of our tests are located inside of our "tests" package. In order to test any individual screen, open the file associated with that screen and click Run. If you have any issues, please email james.easton@centre.edu or come talk to anyone in Weast Bridges United.

PLEASE NOTE: Some of our tests throw exceptions, these are intentional. Pay no attention to them.

In order to actually run our program, functionality to start the server has been added into the main method of BPApplication. Thus, all you need to do to start the application is run BPApplication. 

Note: If you close the application, then the server is still running until you manually terminate the program from the eclipse console. This means that if you close it and try and run the application again, you will get some errors in the eclipse console; these can be ignored, since they are just saying that the port is already in use. However, if you do want to restart the program entirely (server and all), make sure that you terminate the program from inside of the eclipse console.

Note the initial admin's username is "admin" and their password is "admin".
